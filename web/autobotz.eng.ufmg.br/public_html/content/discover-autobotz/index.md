Autobotz is a group managed by students and tutored by Guilherme Raffo, professor of Automation Engineering in UFMG and it's a part of the research group MACRO, runned by him.

Our main focus are autonomous robotics, mecatronic and control.

Autobotz was founded in 2012 by students who wanted to put in pratical the subjects they've learned in graduation, exploring what engineering has to offer to open minded, hunger apprentices.
